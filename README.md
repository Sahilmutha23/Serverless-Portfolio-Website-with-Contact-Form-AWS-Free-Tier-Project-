Serverless-Portfolio-Website-with-Contact-Form-AWS-Free-Tier-Project-
A fully serverless, cost-efficient portfolio website built using AWS services—hosted on the Free Tier. Includes a working contact form that securely sends messages via email without using any backend servers.

🚀 Project Overview
This project showcases how to build and deploy a static portfolio website using:

Amazon S3 for hosting

AWS Lambda for backend logic

API Gateway to handle contact form submissions

Amazon SES for sending emails

CloudFront for secure global content delivery

IAM for permissions

CloudWatch for monitoring and alerts

The goal: Create a modern, secure, and interactive portfolio with zero server management and minimal cost.

📌 Features
Fully static site hosted on Amazon S3

Contact form that triggers Lambda and sends email using SES

Global HTTPS delivery via CloudFront

Secure communication and role-based access using IAM

CloudWatch alerts for monitoring Lambda performance

Total monthly cost: ~$0 (AWS Free Tier)

🔧 Architecture Flow
User visits site via a custom domain or S3 URL.

CloudFront delivers the static content securely.

Contact form sends a POST request to API Gateway.

API Gateway invokes a Lambda function.

Lambda validates the form and uses SES to email the message.

User receives a success message on the website.
